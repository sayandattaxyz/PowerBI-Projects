*****************  Power Query steps for tables:  *******************
1. dim_date:
	- remove the column 'day_type'
	- we are deleting this because, we got a feedback from the mock dashboard review that Friday and Saturday are           
	  considered as weekends in the industry and not sunday. But In our datasets, saturday and sunday are considered           
	  as weekends. So we delete this column and re-create day type using calculated columns.

2. dim_rooms
	- The column names are not captured here. We need to select "Use First Row as Headers" option .
